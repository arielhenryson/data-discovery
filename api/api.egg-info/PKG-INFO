# Data Discovery API

## Setup Local Environment with Conda

Create and activate a Conda environment:
Open your terminal and run the following commands. This will create a new environment named data-agent with Python 3.11 and activate it.

```bash
conda create --name data-agent python=3.11 -y
conda activate data-agent
```

Install dependencies:
With the environment activated, install the project dependencies. This command reads the pyproject.toml file and installs the required packages.

```bash
pip install .
```

How to run the server
Once your environment is set up and the dependencies are installed, use the following command to run the server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
